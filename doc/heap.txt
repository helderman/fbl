Need a mark-and-scan GC.
Too bad we have different cell sizes.
Easy way out would be to use a union (i.e. just allocate max size)
But I think this is a nice opportunity to write a GC that
copies from one memory block to another.
(Maybe this even makes it possible to do it in realtime; not important now.)

First, walk the tree.
Starting point is top of stack.
Every node you encounter:

if node is in new memory block
	back off
elseif type of node is 'moved'
	reroute the pointer that brought us here
	back off
else
	copy the node to the other memory block
	overwrite the original node with type 'moved'; refer to copy
	reroute the pointer that brought us here
	proceed recursively (how?)
